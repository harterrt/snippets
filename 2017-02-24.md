* [Bug 1336617](http://bugzil.la/1336617): Investigate configuration-only solution to simple testpilot pipelines

  I completed a couple of consulting engagements in the last two weeks and both projects had very similar goals.
  Our clients very frequently want a simple ETL job to filter, flatten, and format testpilottest data.
  We plan on running many more of these experiments by the end of the year
  and each experiment will have a different data format.

  I'm experimenting with some simple code that makes it easy to write these ETL jobs declaratively.
  These are currently scheduled via ATMO, but Roberto's working on a way to schedule these via Airflow ([Bug 1340595](http://bugzil.la/1340595)).
* Consulting:
  * Wrote up some [Weirdness with Parquet Write](https://gist.github.com/harterrt/5e0d3db9272fb85c7c493b8e9f3a61ff).
    Revised to [Coalesce affects Parallelism](https://gist.github.com/harterrt/2d99bf832c66f907b88357758bb77abf).
  * [Bug 1336613](http://bugzil.la/1336613): Build pipeline for cliqz testpilot result data
    
    The ATMO profile daily table job was failing for an unknown reason.
    Took some time to debug and backfill the data.

  * [Bug 1339200](http://bugzil.la/1339200): Make containers data available in re:dash

    Parquet write was failing for an unknown reason.
    Hadoop was complaining about not having any diskspace in the local drives.
    Moving from `s3a://` to `s3n://` fixed the issue.
* Review:
  * Two ETL configs ([one](https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-reports/pull/28#event-973425273), [two](https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-reports/pull/27#event-973424666))

# Next

* [Bug 1329840](http://bugzil.la/1329840): Build Comprehensive Data Documentation
  * Set a schedule that will get the documentation and training ready for SFO
  * Add documentation to the gitbook repo, so new contributers know how to get started
* [Bug 1336617](http://bugzil.la/1336617): Investigate configuration-only solution to simple testpilot pipelines
  * I created some boilerplate code last week to make declarative ETL.
    I need to refactor the code to make it reusable.
    The code is currently used for the following ETL jobs:
      * Cliqz and Container experiments: https://github.com/harterrt/cliqz_ping_pipeline
      * Snoozetabs: http://reports.telemetry.mozilla.org/post/etl/testpilot/snoozetabs.kp
      * Pulse: http://reports.telemetry.mozilla.org/post/etl/testpilot/pulse.kp
* Figure out next steps for the analysis training
