# Done

* [Bug 1249658](http://bugzil.la/1249658): Add child histograms to the longitudinal dataset
  * Spent some time getting test cases together and prototyping solutions
  * Have a candidate change ready, but it needs revising - very verbose and repetetive.
    [Branch](https://github.com/harterrt/telemetry-batch-view/tree/83141765aeb37016dbc51968bfdc142b89363dc8)
* Interviews
  * Conducted 2 interviews with feedback.
  * Standardized my questions for Data Scientist interviews.
* Documentation
  * After discussing documentation with jezdez in Hawaii, I think we should
    move our documentation out of the wiki as much as possible.
  * Researched appropriate tools to centralize our documentation in Github
  * I'm leaning towards a Pelican based setup, but may use ReadTheDocs

I expect review to be slow over the next week as people go on vacation.
I'll be available most of next week.
