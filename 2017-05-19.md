  * Review [BHR Dashboard](https://squarewave.github.io/?thread=0)
    * This dashboard is getting a lot of attention.
      When I provided analysis review a few weeks ago, I suggested metric
      changes but didn't hear back about the implementation.
      I wanted to verify the changes and that the new metrics made sense.

  * Cliqz client id decryption - the decrypted client id in the cliqz_testpilottest
    table doesn't match the client id in the cliqz_search table.
    Consulted with cliqz team to find the issue, fixed decryption function,
    and backfilled data.
